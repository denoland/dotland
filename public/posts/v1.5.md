Today we are releasing Deno 1.5.0. This release contains a few new features,
many feature stabilizations, and a ton of bug fixes. Here are some highlights:

- [**New and improved bundling**](#new-and-improved-bundling): `deno bundle` now
  has tree shaking, and is up to 15x faster than 1.4
- [**`alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt` added**](#codealertcode-codeconfirmcode-and-codepromptcode-added):
  web compatible prompt APIs to interact with a user
- [**Improvements to the REPL**](#improvements-to-the-repl): tab completion,
  code syntax highlighting and top level await are now available

If you already have Deno installed you can upgrade to 1.5 by running
`deno upgrade`. If you are installing Deno for the first time, you can use one
of the methods listed below:

```shell
# Using Shell (macOS and Linux):
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

# Using PowerShell (Windows):
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex

# Using Homebrew (macOS):
brew install deno

# Using Scoop (Windows):
scoop install deno

# Using Chocolatey (Windows):
choco install deno
```

# New features and changes

## Improved bundling

Since the last release we have been hard at work to refactor our entire
TypeScript compiler infrastructure. Because of this we were able to replace our
aging bundling infrastructure with a new bundler based on
[swc](https://swc.rs/).

This has led to a **3x performance improvement** when we type-check your code,
and up to a **15x improvement** if you use the `--no-check` flag.

In addition to the performance improvements the bundler is now capable of tree
shaking your code. This means it will remove code from the bundle that you are
not actually using. This leads to a major size reductions in bundles. For
example a bundle of the
[file_server example](https://deno.land/std/http/file_server.ts) is **35%
smaller** in 1.5 when comparing to 1.4.

Bundles are now also emitted as a standard ES module, which means that dynamic
import will work correctly now, and `import.meta.url` is also set correctly. If
you were using Deno to bundle code for the browser, make sure to load the bundle
as an ES module now (`type="module"` attribute on your `<script>` tag).

## `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt` added

This release adds the web platform APIs `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt`. These
have the same functions as they do in the browser:

- `alert` logs a message to the terminal, and then synchronously blocks until
  you confirm (with `[Enter]`).
- `confirm` prompts the user with a message, and then synchronously blocks until
  the user responds with either `y` or `n` (to signal `yes` or `no`).
- `prompt` requests some input from the user, and blocks synchronously until the
  user has entered the text and pressed `[Enter]`.

Here is a little demo of these functions in action. You can try it out by
running `deno run https://deno.land/posts/v1.5/alert_confirm_prompt.js`.

```js
let name = "";

while (true) {
  name = prompt("What is your name?");

  if (confirm(`Are you sure ${name} is your name?`)) {
    break;
  }
}

alert(`Hello ${name}!`);
```

## Improvements to the REPL

The REPL has had a major refactor enabling several new features. Here are some
of the highlights:

- **Tab completion of object properties and methods**: to use this, just press
  `Tab` to cycle through the list of properties and methods.
- **Code syntax highlighting**: code that you enter is now syntax highlighted if
  your terminal supports colors. You can disable this with the `NO_COLOR`
  environment variable.
- **Top level await support**: you can now just `await` promises in the REPL
  without having to wrap your call in an async IIFE.

## Stricter type checks in stable

This release enables the `isolatedModules` TypeScript compiler option for all
users by default. In the 1.4 release this flag was enabled for users using
`--unstable`. This option enables some stricter checks in the TypeScript
compiler that will likely lead to some new errors you have not seen before:

```
ERROR TS1205: Re-exporting a type when the '--isolatedModules' flag is provided requires using 'export type'.
```

These errors occur when interfaces or type aliases are re-exported. To fix the
error, change your re-exports to use `export type`. Example:

```ts
// Bad
export { MyType } from "./mod.ts";

// Good
export type { MyType } from "./mod.ts";
```

For now you can override this option in a `tsconfig.json`.

## `Deno` API additions and stabilizations

We have stabilized `Deno.fsync()`, `Deno.fdatasync()`, and their synchronous
counterparts. These low-level methods are for ensuring modified file data is
written to the disk drive.

There are also two new unstable APIs introduced to `--unstable`:

- `Deno.sleepSync()` - This function can be used to synchronously sleep. This
  will block the event loop, blocking all async operations, and JavaScript
  execution. In most cases you will want to use `setTimeout` to sleep as this
  does not block the event loop.
- `Deno.systemCpuInfo()` - This function can be used to get information about
  number of cores available in the machine as well as the speed of the CPU.

## `deno lint` updates

`deno lint` has gotten some new rules this release. The main one is `camelcase`:
it checks that all of your variable declarations use `camelCase` formatting. We
are hoping to stabilize `deno lint` for Deno 1.6.

In addition to the new rules, we have introduced hints for lint diagnostics.
These hints will suggest how the lint errors can be fixed.

Finally `deno lint` has a website now that you can use to view documentation and
explanations for the rules. You can find it at https://lint.deno.land.

## `deno fmt --ignore` now stable

The `deno fmt --ignore` flag is now available without the `--unstable` flag.
This flag can be used to ignore some files or folders from being formatted or
checked by the formatter.

## Changes to `std`

The `assertStringContains` and `assertArrayContains` methods in
`std/testing/asserts.ts` have been renamed to `assertStringIncludes` and
`assertArrayIncludes` respectively, to match the the naming of the `includes`
method on strings and arrays. To update your code, simply rename the imported
methods:

```diff
- import { assertStringContains, assertArrayContains } from "https://deno.land/std@0.74.0/testing/asserts.ts";
-
- assertStringContains("denosaur", "deno")
- assertArrayContains(["deno", "new", "release"], "new")
+ import { assertStringIncludes, assertArrayIncludes } from "https://deno.land/std@0.75.0/testing/asserts.ts";
+
+ assertStringIncludes("denosaur", "deno")
+ assertArrayIncludes(["deno", "new", "release"], "new")
```

In addition to this renaming, a `assertExists` and `assertObjectMatch` assertion
have been added to `std/testing/asserts.ts`:

- `assertExists` asserts that the passed value is not `null` or `undefined`.
  ```js
  assertExists("foo"); // passes
  assertExists(""); // passes
  assertExists(0); // passes
  assertExists(null); // throws
  assertExists(undefined); // throws
  ```
- `assertObjectMatch` asserts that the `expected` value is a subset of the
  `actual` value.
  ```js
  assertObjectMatch({ a: "b", c: "d" }, { a: "b", c: "d" }); // passes
  assertObjectMatch({ a: "b", c: "d" }, { a: "b" }); // passes
  assertObjectMatch({ a: "b", c: "d" }, { a: "b", c: "f" }); // throws
  assertObjectMatch({ a: "b" }, { a: "b", c: "d" }); // throws
  ```
